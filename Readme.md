### Rainfall Anomaly Detection
- This code is written using Python 3.12 version.
- The aim is to detect anomaly from a real-time continuous data stream of floating-point numbers.
- The code implements a function to emulate a data stream considering uniformity, seasonal variability and anomalies.
- statistics is used to determine the anomaly based upon mean and standard deviation of the data set in real time, as the values are streamed.
- matpltlib is used to create plot, updating at uniform time interval with each input.
